# TwoD_Structures
a series of python scripts based on pymatgen to standardize 2D structures or other surface models

required package: pymatgen
python version: python 3

## current functions:  
TwoD_Structures: standardize slab models, especially thoese whose lattice vector c is not normal to the surface.  
Heterostructure: Heterostruture construction given  the lattice mismatch tolerance.
